# AnimeSchedule Api

A complete AnimeSchedule Api v3 client implemented in Rust

If you see any bugs, please report them. Mostly these may be instances "null" appears in the api but was assumed to always exist in the deserialized types. While this was quickly tested with a bit of data to hopefully get a complete picture, this is not guaranteed to be always correct. Other than that, it should be feature complete and working.
